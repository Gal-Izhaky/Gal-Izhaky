# 👋 Hi, I'm Gal Izhaky!  

### 🌍 **A 17-Year-Old Developer from Israel**  
I'm a Fullstack developer from Rishon Lezion, Israel, currently studying in 12th grade, majoring in **Software Engineering**. 

I have **over 5 years of experience** in programming and creating applications and websites. I've learned programming primarily from the internet, but I did take several courses (including [Mamram class](https://leadersapp.co.il/mamram-program-english/) and [Sunspark](https://sunspark.org/%d7%9e%d7%a1%d7%9c%d7%95%d7%9c-%d7%a4%d7%99%d7%aa%d7%95%d7%97-%d7%90%d7%a4%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%a7%d7%a6%d7%99%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%92%d7%90%d7%95%d7%95%d7%94-java-me/)). 
In 10th grade, I was a part of [Mabat project](https://pop.education.gov.il/mabat/), a program for high-achieving students that involves thinking of a product idea, development it , and presenting it in a competition. Even though my Mabat project wasn't finished because something similar was released in the middle of development, I learned a lot about AI, and product development.
