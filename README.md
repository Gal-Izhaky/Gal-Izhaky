### **A 17-Year-Old Developer**  
I'm a Software/Fullstack developer, currently studying **Software Engineering** in the open university of Israel. 

**over 6 years of experience** in programming and creating applications and websites. 
Learned programming primarily from the internet, with a help of several courses when I was starting ([Mamram class](https://leadersapp.co.il/mamram-program-english/) and [Sunspark](https://sunspark.org/%d7%9e%d7%a1%d7%9c%d7%95%d7%9c-%d7%a4%d7%99%d7%aa%d7%95%d7%97-%d7%90%d7%a4%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%a7%d7%a6%d7%99%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%92%d7%90%d7%95%d7%95%d7%94-java-me/)). 

was a part of [Mabat project](https://pop.education.gov.il/mabat/), a program for high-achieving students that involves thinking of a product idea, developing it, and presenting it in a competition. 

Even though my Mabat project wasn't finished, because something similar was released in the middle of development, I learned a lot about AI and product development.
